# Network Analysis: A Song of Ice and Fire

This project explores the character network of George R. R. Martin's **A Song of Ice and Fire** series. Using the `igraph` library in `R`, an undirected, weighted graph is constructed from the relationships between characters, enabling analysis of network properties, centrality measures, and more.
